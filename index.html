            Triple 7 Blessed has a big announcement to make, we are moving to
            the Daytona Beach area! Don Smón's father is sick and they just want
            to go home to help take care of their family and to start a new
            chapter in their life. Things are going to be interesting, we are
            focused on saving up for more equipment and a space to produce our
            music/art. Triple 7 Blessed is pretty new still, so a lot of people
            don't know but it was originally started as a avenue to promote
            local Twin Cities artists, and as the only artists that work under
            the studio are moving to Florida, we will probably aim to promote
            local Florida artists through Triple 7 Blessed but with
            collaborative and stylistic elements from the Twin Cities. Triple 7
            Blessed will be a love story written by Daytona for the Twin Cities
            area. 777 Don Smón and 777 Conflicted Angel excited to see where
            this move will take us. We can't wait to release more projects and
            art for everyone to see the beauty of being human, imperfect and
            looking towards better things. We love all of you so much, please
            stay in touch and reach out whenever, all of you in my Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're aiming to go in a few months, so there's still time to do
            stuff with us before we leave! 777 Don Smón has been working on some
            drawings in the <mark class='redacted'>Tired Visuals</mark> series,
            while 777 Conflicted Angel has been working on designs for new
            clothes. New music is in the works, but no spoilers can be given.
            We can't wait to show you all, and the world the art we've been
            working on. Much love to all the fans.
